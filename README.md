**Delhi Metro - Analysis Report**
## **Introduction**
Metro Delhi is one of the most efficient and most common means of transportation in the Indian capital. This project analyzes data records using the Delhi Metro system to derive insights into ward location, connectivity and possible improvements. In analysis, Python libraries such as Pandas and Folium are used to manipulate and visualize data. Data records help you understand the structure and layout of a Delhi Metro network. (Examples: yellow lines, blue lines).
  
  **Dataset Features**
  
  The dataset includes the following key features:

 - Station Name: The name of the metro station.
 - Latitude & Longitude: Geographic coordinates of the metro station.
 - Line: The metro line to which the station belongs (e.g., Yellow Line, Blue Line).
 - Station Layout : Indicates whether a station is an Elevated, Underground and At-grade.

  **Data Load and Explore**
- Data records were loaded using Pandas.
- A basic check has been performed to identify missing values. Handling Missing Data
- A summary of missing values ​​has been generated.

**Data Visualization**
 - Mapping Stations: Using Folium, an interactive map of metro stations was created.
 - Distribution of Stations by Line: A bar chart was generated to display the number of stations on each metro line.
 - Interchange Stations: Special attention was given to interchange stations to analyze their impact on network connectivity.
  
  **Important Results**
  - Data Records provide a comprehensive view of the Delhi Metro system.  This study provides insight into station distribution, exchange points, and possible improvement areas. Future work involves consolidating driver data, allowing you to understand peak times and congestion patterns.
